            Hello, my name is Justin Jongstra and I am a 21 year old student. I have a passion for learning, mountain
            biking, drawing, playing games, and coding. I love to study and challenge myself in new and exciting ways,
            and I
            am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and grow as a person. In my free time, I enjoy hitting the
            trails on my mountain bike and exploring new places, as well as playing video games and coding projects. I
            am a
            creative individual who is constantly seeking new opportunities to express my ideas and bring them to life.

            I am mostly interested in PHP (especially the laravel framework currently), C++ and JavaScript, but I'm
            always
            open to learning new languages and frameworks. I am currently studying at RijnIJssel in Arnhem, the
            Netherlands,
            where I am studying for an MBO 4 diploma in Software Development.
